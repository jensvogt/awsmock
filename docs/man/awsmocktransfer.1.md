## NAME

```awsmocktransfer``` AwsMock Transfer Server module

## DESCRIPTION

The AWS Transfer API is a powerful tool that empowers users to establish FTP(S) servers with ease. These servers serve
as gateways, allowing direct access to files residing in Amazon S3 buckets. This functionality streamlines file
management processes, making it simpler and more efficient to handle data stored in S3 by providing a familiar FTP
interface for users to interact with their files securely. Whether youâ€™re looking to facilitate file transfers or
enhance your data access capabilities, the AWS Transfer API simplifies the process and extends the versatility of
your cloud storage infrastructure.

The TransferManager module can be configured using the ```awslocal``` command. For details of the ```awslocal``` command
see the corresponding man page ```awslocal(1)```.

Currently only IPv4 is supported, so if you need to connect to the transfer server using a Linux/macOS FTP client, make
sure you set the host to ```127.0.0.1```, instead of ```localhost```, because sometimes on some Linux machines
```localhost``` is resolved to the IPv6 address.

AwsMOck transfer manager supports FTP and SFTP. Usually ```awsmock``` is running as normal user, and the default
configuration file configures the ports to be 2121 for FTP and 2222 for SFTP. If ouy need to use the standard ports
(21 for FTP and 22 for SFTP), you need to run the ```awsmockmgr``` as root user. AwsMock transfer manager does not
support FTP over TLS (as filezilla is using it).

## EXAMPLES

To create a new transfer server:

```
awslocal transfer create-server --protocols ftp
{
    "ServerId": "s-27134679b31c0a9833ee"
}
```

To get a list of all currently available transfer servers:

```
awslocal transfer list-servers
{
    "Servers": [
        {
            "Arn": "arn:aws:transfer:eu-central-1:000000000000:manager/s-27134679b31c0a9833ee",
            "Domain": "",
            "IdentityProviderType": "",
            "EndpointType": "",
            "LoggingRole": "",
            "ServerId": "s-27134679b31c0a9833ee",
            "State": "OFFLINE",
            "UserCount": 1
        }
    ]
}

```

To delete a transfer server:

```
awslocal transfer delete-server --server-userPoolId s-27134679b31c0a9833ee
```

Show a list of all users

```
awslocal transfer list-users --server-id 27134679b31c0a9833ee
{
    "Users": [
        {
            "Arn": "arn:aws:transfer:us-east-1:176354371281:user/s-27134679b31c0a9833ee/anonymous",
            "HomeDirectory": "/",
            "Role": "anonymous",
            "SshPublicKeyCount": 0,
            "UserName": "anonymous"
        },
        {
            "Arn": "arn:aws:transfer:us-east-1:176354371281:user/s-27134679b31c0a9833ee/ftpuser1",
            "HomeDirectory": "ftpuser1",
            "Role": "user",
            "SshPublicKeyCount": 0,
            "UserName": "ftpuser1"
        }
