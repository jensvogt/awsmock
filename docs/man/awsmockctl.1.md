## NAME

```awsmockctl``` AwsMock controller

## SYNOPSIS

awsmockctl [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

## DESCRIPTION

awsmockctl controls and show some insides of the AwsMock AWS cloud simulation. Supported AWS modules are: SQS, SNS
S3, Cognito, TransferServer, Lambda. AwsMock is written in C++ and has a module structure, using different modules for
each AWS service plus a API gateway, which routes the requests to the different modules.

Per default the gateway runs on port 4566, but can be changed in the configuration file. The default configuration file
```/etc/aws-mock.properties```, which can be changed on the command using the ```--config <config-file-path>``` option.

awsmockctl provides a series of commands, which control the different modules. It allows to start/stop different modules
as well as to show the current configuration.

## OPTIONS

```--include-objects```:  
adds objects to the export. By default, only the infrastructure elements are export (SQS queues,
SNS topic, S3 buckets etc.). Settings this option will export also all object (S3 objects, SQS messages, SNS messages,
etc.). Exporting also the objects will result in a rather huge output file, depending on your objects in the different
infrastructure elements.

```--pretty```:  
indent the resulting JSON string to make it more readable. Will increase the output size.

```--config <config-file-path>```:  
starts the controller with a given configuration file. Per default the configuration
file ```/etc/aws-mock.properties``` will
be used. The path should be the absolute path to the configuration file.

```--help```    
shows the usage screen and exists

```--version```    
shows the current version and exists.

## COMMANDS

```list```  
lists the currently running AwsMock modules like S3, SQS, SNS etc. Each line has the format:

```
SQS         RUNNING
SNS         STOPPED
...
```

```stop <module>```  
stops the given module. Modules are S3, SQS, SNS, Transfer, Cognito. Modules names can be given case-insensitive.

```start <module>```  
starts the given module.

```restart <module>```  
restarts the given module.

```logs```  
shows the console logs of the AwsMock manager application ```awsmockmgr```.
See ```awsmockmgr(1)``` for details of the manager.

```loglevel```  
sets the log level of the AwsMock manager ```awsmockmgr```. ```<loglevel>``` can be one of: verbose, debug, info,
warning, error, fatal or none.

```config```  
shows the configuration of the AwsMock API gateway.

```export [modules] [--include-objects] [--pretty]```  
export the current infrastructure to stdout in JSON format. ```modules``` can be space separated list of AwsMock
modules. If no modules are given or the module list contains ```all```, all modules will be exported. IF oyu include
the ```--include-objects``` also all object will be exported (SQS messages, SNS messages, S3 objects, etc.)

```import```  
import the infrastructure from stdin in JSON format.

```show-ftp-users```  
shows the current FTP user (AWS Transfer Family) and their passwords. As AWS does not have the ability to see the
password of a user (specially when you use the in-memory database, this provides a way to see the user passwords.

```clean```  
cleans the infrastructure. This means all SQS queues plus messages, SNS topics plus messages, S3 buckets with all
objects, transfer servers, and lambda functions will be deleted. ALl modules will be still running, but all AwsMock
objects will be emptied.

## EXAMPLES

In oder to show the current running modules:

```
/usr/bin/awsmockctl list
SQS         RUNNING
SNS         RUNNING
S3          RUNNING
```

Stop the SNS module:

```
/usr/bin/awsmockctl stop SNS
/usr/bin/awsmockctl list
SQS         RUNNING
SNS         STOPPED
S3          RUNNING
```

Start the SNS module:

```
/usr/bin/awsmockctl start SNS
/usr/bin/awsmockctl list
SQS         RUNNING
SNS         RUNNING
S3          RUNNING
```

Show the manager logs

Export the S3 infrastructure:

```
/usr/bin/awsmockctl export s3 sqs
{
    "infrastructure": {
     "s3-buckets": [
            {
                "name": "transfer-server",
                "notifications": [
                    {
                        "event": "s3:ObjectCreated:Put",
                        "lambdaArn": "arn:aws:lambda:eu-central-1:000000000000:function:ftp-file-copy",
                        "notificationId": "1234567890123",
                        "queueArn": ""
                    },
                    ....
```

Export the S3 infrastructure to a file ```infrastrcture.json```:

```
/usr/bin/awsmockctl export s3 sqs > infrastrcture.json
```

Show a list of FTP users of server ```s-ed5ce1b1898c146f13e5```:

```
/usr/bin/awsmockctl show-ftp-user s-ed5ce1b1898c146f13e5
```
